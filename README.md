# HCIproject

This project is to develop an AI assistant that features voice interaction, along with visual and memory capabilities, similar to Samantha in the movie "Her".

This project consists of three phases: Phase 1 "Hear What You Hear", Phase 2 "See What You See", and Phase 3 "Feel What You Feel". Each phase requires the completion of different capabilities for the smart assistant: voice dialogue in Phase 1, visual understanding in Phase 2, and agent functionality in Phase 3.

## Phase 1: Hear What You Hear

We seperate the whole phase into two part: server and client.

**For server part:**

First, we should create a connection to client and recieve audio data.
